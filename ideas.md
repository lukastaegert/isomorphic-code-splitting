## Key ideas
* I do not need a build tool for development
  * Let's do web development like it is 2009 again…
  * …while coding like it is 2019
  - Web development: 15 years ago, 10years ago, today (alternative Universe + complex build setup with people waiting) (script tags)
  - But didn't we get some kind of module system in 2015? Supported by most modern browsers?
  - Simple example
* Rollup code-splitting is the native way of doing it
  * Coloring algorithm
  * SystemJS fallback
* Rollup is steadily moving forward, and we need YOU!
  * Tweet about fixed watch mode
